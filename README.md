Modeling and Visualizing the Impact of Healthcare Access and Treatment Availability on the Treatment of Mental Health Disorders Such as Anxiety and Depression Across Countries

March 5, 2025

Project Description
As students at the University of Toronto, a demanding institution with a heavy course load, we have observed many of our peers struggling with mental health issues, such as anxiety and depression. Mental health is an issue that affects people globally, but individuals often experience and respond to mental health challenges in diverse ways, which can be influenced by factors such as healthcare access, treatment availability, and cultural differences. This has prompted us to explore how these factors affect the treatment of mental health disorders, especially in the context of international students from different backgrounds.
Our project question is: How does healthcare access and treatment availability impact the diagnosis and treatment of mental health disorders like depression and anxiety across countries? By analyzing how healthcare systems and treatment options differ across countries, we hope to uncover patterns and correlations that could lead to better, more accessible mental health care globally.
This issue matters because global mental health disparities contribute to untreated or improperly treated mental health disorders, leading to higher rates of suffering, disability, and suicide. As international students, many of us are directly affected by these disparities, and we believe that understanding these issues can lead to more effective mental health policies and better treatment options worldwide. Our goal is to model and visualize the relationships between healthcare access, treatment availability, and mental health outcomes across different countries, which could provide valuable insights into improving global mental health care.

Computational Plan for the Project Data Sources
The following datasets will be used in the project:
• Prevalence of Mental Disorders by Country (from IHME Global Health Data): This dataset includes the global prevalence of mental health disorders such as depression and anxiety across different countries.
• Depression Rates by Country (from World Population Review): Data on depression rates by country, allowing us to compare countries on how widely depression affects their populations.
• Anxiety Rates by Country (from World Population Review): Similar to the depression dataset, but for anxiety rates across different countries.
• Suicide Rates by Country (from World Population Review): Suicide rates are key indicators of untreated mental health issues, and we’ll use this data to analyze how mental health treatment availability impacts suicide rates across countries.
• Beds for Mental Health in General Hospitals (from WHO Global Health Observatory): The number of beds available for mental health care in general hospitals per country. This is crucial for understanding how accessible mental health services are in various regions.
• Beds in Mental Hospitals (from WHO Global Health Observatory): Data on the number of beds in specialized mental health hospitals, which will help us analyze the treatment capacity for mental health patients in different countries.
• Public Expenditure on Mental Health (from Statista): This dataset will help us examine the relationship between public spending on mental health and treatment outcomes, such as access to mental health services and mental health disorder prevalence.
• Mental Health Atlas (from WHO Mental Health Atlas): This dataset includes global mental health policies, resources, and services. It will pro- vide important context for the healthcare systems available in different countries.
